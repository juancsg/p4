		<h2> Summary</h2>
		<p> Unfolding in two parallel stories, two generations of the same Spanish family are drawn to the romance, beauty and danger of Equatorial Guinea. In 1954, strapping young Kilian (Mario Casas, in his most romantic role thus far) journeys from his Huesca home to the African island of Fernando Pó, where he falls perilously in love with Bisila (Berta Vazquez), the beautiful wife of a plantation worker.</p>
	<h3> Review</h3>
		<p> <B> The Hollywood Reporter</B>
		<br> Film Review by Jonathan Holland: <br> <b>This sweepìng, generation-spanning Spanish colonial drama is currently wowing the Spanish box office. </b>
			<br> A reminder that Spanish cinema can still paint on a large canvas, Palm Trees in the Snow is Spain’s best stab yet at an Out of Africa-style colonial/imperial romance. But the pleasures of this rangy drama are largely those of pastiche, residing in its often spectacular visuals and well-crafted set-pieces rather than in its generation-spanning storyline, which has obviously been calculated to manipulate the emotions, but rarely does so in any meaningful way. Given that Spain’s colonial history has barely been tackled on film, this represents something of a missed opportunity. None of which will matter very much to Tree’s planters, who have seen more than a two million admissions and counting since its late December bow.</p>
